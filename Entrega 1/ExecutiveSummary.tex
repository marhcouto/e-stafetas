\chapter{Executive Summary}
In this report, we will analyse a the problem given to us in the context of the practical work of Conception and Analysis of Algorithms. After \textbf{presenting and decomposing the problem}, a \textbf{formalization} will be done, followed by presentation of the \textbf{possible algorithms} to implement int the solution. Finally, a \textbf{prospective solution} will be given, compiling the chosen algorithms and a strategy. Lastly, a list of the \textbf{functionalities} the interface of the program to be built in phase two is presented and a \textbf{conclusion} is given.
