\chapter{Functionalities Implemented}

To aid in the usage of the program, an interface will be developed. This interface will enable the user to perform many actions, both related to the graph's processing and to information about orders, clients, etc.

\subsubsection{Graph Related}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Redo the check to the graph's connectivity (and consequently update the graph if necessary)
    \item Calculate the paths for each vehicle in that day, considering the existing orders
    \item Add or remove a pick up point
    \item Add or remove a delivery point
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Orders and Clients}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add or remove an order (a Client will automatically be removed if he no longer has orders registered to him, past or present)
    \item Add or remove a client from the clients' list, given he does not have any current order (consequently removing the past orders)
    \item List all orders, their Clients and the pick up and delivery points
    \item List past orders, their Clients and the pick up and delivery points
    \item List/Search orders by other filters
    \item List all clients 
    \item List/Search clients by certain filters
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vehicles and Drivers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item List all vehicles and some brief information about them
    \item Add or remove vehicles
    \item Specifically search a vehicles (most likely by its license plate)
    \item List all drivers and some brief information about them
    \item Add (hire) or remove (fire) a driver
    \item Specifically search for a driver
\end{itemize}

This list only presents a preview of the program's interface, more or less functionalities may be implemented.
