\chapter{Conclusion}

In sum, the task at end was considered to be fulfilled with success. The problem was formalized and divided into subproblems, which were accessed individually. In each assessment, a research for a possible solution was carried out, originating the possible algorithms to use. Each algorithm was carefully analysed, in order to decide whether it was a suitable candidate for each job. Finally a solution was fabricated, compiling multiple algorithms and a final strategy for the problem.
