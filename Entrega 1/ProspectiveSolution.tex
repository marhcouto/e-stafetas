\chapter{Prospective Solution}

\paragraph {} Problems that are found across the iterations and respective way to solve them using algorithms.Pseudo-code and temporal complexity are also showed.

\section{Pre-Processing of Input Data}
Before going threw with the problem resolution and trying to find the shortest path for the vans, we need to process the graph, checking for any inaccessible vertices (blocked by construction) or (???? - Podemos/fazemos isto?) not using the ones that are too far away from the starting point and from the delivery points. The point of reducing the number of vertices and edges we analyse from the vertices is to enhance the temporal efficiency of all algorithms.

\section{First calculations for Shortest Path}
Having the graph already pre processed it's time to calculate the shortest path between all the vertices so the map is all processed for the first time. This can be done either using the Bi-directional Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
